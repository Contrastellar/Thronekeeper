# Thronekeeper BETA
# Thronekeeper is a straight-forward recursion bot, that is used to primarily subvert the typical Message deletion message found in other moderation bots.
# This is a recursion method, where per-channel, she takes the message log, and deletes the messages that match up with a specific user ID.
